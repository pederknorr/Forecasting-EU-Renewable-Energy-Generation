# Forecasting Variable Renewable Energy Production in the EU

**Authors**: Peder Norr

### Introduction:

As the climate crisis continues to grow in severity, more and more countries and utilities are turning towards renewable energy sources as sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuel based sources. Chief among these are solar and wind energy. However, these two sources are known as variable renewable energies (VREs), as they are dependent on several variables like the weather. Because of this, integrating VRE sources into a power grid can be difficult due to ever changing levels of output. However, accurate generation forecasts can assuage this issue, and help utilities improve electricity allocation to more efficiently harness VREs.  This project contains analyses of renewable energy generation data in order to provide European countries and utilities a tool which would allow them to make more accurate energy generation forecasts, and thus better harness the power of renewable energy sources. 


### Business problem:

European countries and utilities want to be able to better utilize VREs and more efficiently integrate them into their power grids. However, they need to be able to more accurately forecast VRE generation in order to improve electricity scheduling and allocation. This project will conduct time series analyses and build a forecasting tool that will help EU countries to better forecast VRE generation and enable the more efficient usage of renewable energy.


### Data:

The data used in these analyses come from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) [Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show). ENTSOE represents 42 electricity transmission system operators from across Europe. It promotes closer cooperation among Europe's TSOs to achieve the EU's energy and climate policy objectives. One of its main objective centers on the integration of renewable energy sources  into the continent's power system. 

In order to reduce computation requirements, this project will focus on the top 5 producers of variable renewable energy in the EU: Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. The data sets used below are time series from June 2021 to July 2021, containing 720 entries of the hourly production of wind and solar energy (in megawatts) in the respective country.
